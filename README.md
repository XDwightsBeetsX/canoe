# Making a Solo Race Canoe

I plan on constructing my own race canoe for the [Texas Water Safari (TWS)](https://www.texaswatersafari.org/)

I want this boat to be [USCA C-1](c1.md) and [solo unlimited](solo-unlimited.md) compatible for use in the TWS. The *unlimited* categories have no restrictions, so I plan to make a USCA C-1 boat with a detachable rudder, which is the main difference between the two categories and offers a huge advantage.

## Goals

1. Meet **USCA C-1 specs**
2. **Light** (aiming for sub-50lb after reinforcements and seat)
3. **Detachable rudder** mounting system
4. **Race features** such as jug holders and handles.
5. As **cheap** as possible. Retail for similar canoes is about $3500.

## Approach

- To meet **goal 1**, detailed plans will be made for the canoe, referencing current race canoe models.
- In order to meet **goal 2**, the canoe needs to be made of a light material. Endurance racing canoes are often built from carbon fiber-epoxy composites, which are very light, while maintaining integrity.
- **Goal 3** can be met by building a lightweight rudder mounting assembly that can be attached to the stern, and controlled with attachable pedals and wire.
- Race features such as jug holders and handles, as well as most other niceties can be added after forming the boat, and taylored to meet **goal 4**.
- In order to reduce costs to achieve **goal 5**, alternatives to carbon fiber-epoxy composites will be researched, and some tests will be done on curing time/temperature, and molding to ensure the boat is formed properly.

## Materials

Building with a composite consists of adding a *resin* to a *fiber* matrix. The fibers provide the tensile strength, while the hard resin provides rigidity and shape.
